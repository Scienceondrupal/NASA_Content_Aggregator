The Earth Data Federated Content Tool (FCT) supports sharing and re-use of Earth Data content; sharing of Earthdata.nasa.gov content with the DAACs, sharing of DAACs content with Earth Data and sharing of content from DAAC to DAACs.
The Earth Data FCT allows existing content to remain at the original location while at the same time provides a unified solution for managing Earth Data content. It allows participating entities to retain a large measure of autonomy over the content they make available, as well as the content they choose to re-use. Finally, the FCT provides a common interface for all producers and consumers of Earth Data content.
The Earth Data FCT supports two roles: Content Producer and Content Consumer. The most common scenario is that the same person is both the Producer and the Consumer of Earth Data Content. Content Producers are able to use the tool to register/ingest their feeds into Earth Data and/or use the tool to create their feed(s) and tag them with the appropriate keyword tags that will be used in the keyword search. Content Consumers, are able to view all the feeds that are available and to subscribe to any or all the feeds available. 
Content Providers (DAACs, Earth Data, and Others) register their feed(s) from existing content sources using standards defined by Earth Data. Earth Data aggregates all feeds and makes a single Earth Data feed available for consumption by Earth Data and others. Content Consumers may select pertinent stories from the Earth Data feed, and place them within their sites as desire. Some feeds (e.g. outages, meeting notification, system updates, etc.) may be required to be included on all EOSDIS website.
